excerpt: &#34;Be still and wait without hope / For hope would be hope for the wrong thing, wait without love / For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith / But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting / So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.” Eliot
